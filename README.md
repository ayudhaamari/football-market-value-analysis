## 📊 Data Sources

This project utilizes two primary data sources:

1. **[Player Scores Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores)**: A kaggle dataset that on a high level, uses transfermarkt-scraper to pull the data from Transfermark website and a set of Python scripts and SQL to curate it and publish it there. 


Clean, structured and automatically updated football data from Transfermarkt, including:

   ```
   - 60,000+ games from many seasons on all major competitions
   - 400+ clubs from those competitions
   - 30,000+ players from those clubs
   - 400,000+ player market valuations historical records
   - 1,200,000+ player appearance records from all games
   - and more!
   ```

The dataset is composed of multiple CSV files with information on competitions, games, clubs, players and appearances that is automatically updated **once a week** by the original author. Each file contains the attributes of the entity and the IDs that can be used to join them together.

2. **[Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/)**: The leading website for football transfer news and market valuations.

<img src="images/football-3.jpg" width="800">

From Transfermarkt, we will gather the following key information for each player:

- *Player Name*
- *Current Team*
- *Domestic league in which player's team competes*
- *Age*
- *Playing position*
- *Nationality*
- *Years Left on Contract*
- *Transfer Value (our main variable)*

These data points have been identified as significant determinants of a player's market value based on the available information from Transfermarkt.

## 🚀 Future Goals

The project aims to provide insights that could potentially increase the overall market value of players by optimizing performance metrics and understanding market value determinants.

## 💼 Business Problem

<img src="images/football-2.jpg" width="1000">

In the dynamic world of football, player valuations have become a critical aspect of club management and transfer strategies. This analysis aims to address the following key questions:

1. **Performance Metrics**: How do goals, assists, and other on-field statistics influence a player's market value?
2. **Age and Potential**: What role does a player's age and perceived potential play in their valuation?
3. **League Prestige**: How does playing in top-tier leagues like the Premier League or La Liga affect a player's worth?
4. **International Reputation**: What impact do international performances and national team status have on market value?
5. **Transfer History**: How do past transfer fees and frequency of transfers affect a player's current valuation?
6. **Position Specifics**: Are certain playing positions valued more highly than others in the transfer market?
7. **Club Status**: How does the reputation and financial power of a player's current club influence their market value?
8. **Injury History**: To what extent do past injuries and perceived injury risk affect a player's valuation?

[... and all other things ...]

By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, this project aims to provide insights for clubs to optimize their transfer strategies, financial planning, and player development programs.
